      <p>
        There isn't really a lot of interest to say here. I’ve always loved
        technology. I was the kind of kid who had to read the instruction book
        before playing a new game, even though the controls were almost always
        jump, fire/attack and super attack. For those reading this that can’t
        quite imagine that, it was a very long time ago when a console
        controller only had a directional pad and two buttons. That wasn’t even
        the start of it, the first game I ever played came on a cassette tape
        and took about 7 minutes to load, and that was if it worked the first
        time. No disc, no internal hard drive, no operating system. Ever since
        then I have always been excited about what ever the next generation of
        tech would look like. Computers, consoles, cameras, etc. Yet somehow, I
        spent most of my working life in retail. It was never something I was
        passionate about, tech was what I was passionate about, retail was just
        something I was good at while tech was my hobby to play with. I wish I’d
        made the switch to a tech-based job sooner. Here's to moving to a job I
        can truly be happy in.
