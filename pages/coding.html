        <h2>Tech Educators and Beyond</h2>
        <p>
          Below is a series of coding projects that I’m working on/completed. I’ll start by recreating the lesson assignments I learned from the
          <a href="https://techeducators.co.uk">Tech Educators Full Stack Bootcamp</a>.<br />
          For efficiencies sake I’ll probably have to merge some of the lessons together into one page. I doubt anyone would think it’s worth
          dedicating a whole page just to show that I can assign a value to a variable. In between that I will be adding other projects from various
          sources because it’s fun and I like learning something new.

        <h2>Tech Educators 201</h2>
        <p>
          This was pretty much the first thing we did that had the big three in one go. This page is all one page that holds the HTML, CSS and the
          JavaScript. It’s mostly just playing with a very simple prompt and alert box.

        </h2>
        <p>
          After four weeks of HTML, CSS and JavaScript we were given four days to complete our first project. This was partly to evaluate how we were
          getting on by the middle of the course and partly to finally give us complete creative control to see what we could come up with and to
          build a bit of confidence in our newly acquired abilities. At least, that was my understanding of it. I may have made up some of that
          reasoning. For my project I made a web site for a gaming café that let people book seats at a game event. This was all made by hand on VS
          Code using HTML, CSS, JavaScript and utilising local storage.
